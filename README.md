WebTOP
======

WebTOP is a 3D interactive computer graphics system that simulates and visualizes optical phenomena. It was developed at Mississippi State University between 1997 and 2009. The 3D models are VRML, and the physics simulations are coded in Java. These simulations include 
- Waves
- Lenses
- The Human Eye
- Reflection and Refraction
  - Vectorial
  - Waves in Two Media
  - Waves in Three Media
  - Waveguide
- Polarization
- Interference
  - Michelson Interferometer
  - Fabry Perot Etalon
-Diffraction
  - Fraunhofer N-Slit
  - TransmissionGrating
  - Rayleigh Resolution
  - Fresnel Single Slit
  - Fresnel Circular
- Lasers
- Scattering
- Diffraction
  - Photoelectric Effect
  - Two-Slit Photon
