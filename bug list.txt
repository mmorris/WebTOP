buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 257: PlaneSensor plane is not transformed
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: 1.0
Description:
The invisible plane of the PlaneSensor is not affected by Transforms. As a
result it is not possible to lay the sensor plane into the xz-plane to move
objects on the ground. In the attached scene "PlaneSensorTestXZ.x3dv" one
should be able to move the blue cone in the xz-plane (red plane) as with Flux
or BS Contact. Indeed, with Xj3D the blue cone is also movable in the xz-plane,
but the motion along the z-axis is wrong (when the mouse cursor is dragged
upwards, the cone is moving towards the viewer). This is because the invisible
plane of the sensor is still parallel to the xy-plane. The Transform doesn't
rotate the invisible plane like the red plane. The green cone is just to verify
in which direction the rotation took place.

Please fix this asap, because it's really annoying. Thanks!



buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 276: TouchSensor active area does not transform within a layer
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: unspecified
Description:
Translation and scale do not seem to affect the active area of the touchsensor
when the grouping of the touchsensor and the shape fall within a layer. This
creates an odd situation where the active area does not report back correct
hitpoint, isActive, and isOver data.


buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 280: Color of IndexedFaceSet cannot be set dynamically more than once
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: 1.0
Description:
Using Xj3D v.1.0 installed via the Windows full installer and JDK 1.5.0_07,
IndexedFaceSet geometry cannot be recolored more than once by changing the
"color" field of the X3DColor node associated with the geometry.  Using the
MFColor.setValue(int, float[][]) method to set the colors works for the first
color change, but subsequent changes are not reflected on the displayed
geometry.  For instance, if the color of an object is changed dynamically from
an initial color of red to green, and then again changed to blue, the user will
see the IndexedFaceSet's color change from red to green, but not from green to
blue.  Using MFColor.getValue(float[][]) to read the Color node's value shows
that the values are being sent and received correctly, but the change is not
reflected in the displayed geometry.



buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 277: Unable to Dynamically Set Heights of an ElevationGrid
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: 1.0
Description:
ElevationGrid nodes do not respond to new values being sent to the "set_height"
field.  In effect, an Xj3D enabled application that loads an X3D file with an
ElevationGrid whose heights are defined in the X3D cannot modify the heights of
that ElevationGrid.



buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 220: OGLExtrusion generates incorrect endcaps
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: 1.0RC2
Description:
The summary says it all really, just feed it an extrusion and have a look. The
sourcecode also contains comments that explains the current implementation is
incomplete.



buzilla.xj3d.org Bug 274: Unable to Dynamically Set Heights of an ElevationGrid
Status: NEW (as of July 25, 2006)
Xj3D version: 1.0
Description:
In addition to the texture memory leak reported in
http://bugzilla.xj3d.org/show_bug.cgi?id=273 here comes a demo (MemLeak3.zip)
which shows that there are also geometry leaks (at least the way I use the
SAI).

The reason why I'm reporting these issues is that my project is a little CVE
thing and everytime the user changes the room it means a replaceWorld(). With
the current situation the user can not visit too many rooms before the system
starts swapping or an OutOfMemoryException is raised.
[WebTOP Note:  This is likely the same error that we get, the reporter just
encounters it through a different series of events.  Yumetech disagrees
that this is a problem with their software. [PC] ]
