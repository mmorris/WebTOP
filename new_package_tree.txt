This file gives my thoughts for a new package tree for WebTOP libraries.
If we really plan to make this an open source project, we should follow
the convention of other Java open source projects and package our
libraries under the "org" root package.  Since we would be repackaging
anyway, I also propose the following more organized and modularized 
package tree.  This may also help when multiple programmers are developing
modules simultaneously.
