New directories:
----------------------
* create_installer_scripts := example batch file w/ command line for creating the installer
* doc                      := Place for license file, etc., and izPack docs
* jar_scripts              := Batch file for JARing a module
* manifests                := Storage location for manifest files
* module_jars              := Storage location for JAR'd modules.
* example_installer        := An example installer.  
                              NOTE: The manifest file for the circular.jar 
                              executable is incorrect, so it won't actually 
                              run. The class-path attribute of the manifest 
                              needs to have the wildcards taken out.

New files:
----------------------
* install.xml          := sample installer for a single module
* install_circular.jar := sample installer program (not from most recent build tools)
* create_installer_scripts/create_installer_circular.bat  := total commands required to 
                                                             create the installer for 
                                                             a build module.


DOCUMENTATION:
----------------------
You're reading it!  There are also the documents that I used to figure this out in the 
/doc directory.  Remember, this is an open-source project, so documentation is...meh...  
This project's documentation isn't too bad, though.

Also, reference the "tutorial" PDF alongside the "installer.xml" sample for Circular in 
the repository root directory.  Hopefully the plethora of XML comments will make things 
muddie....I mean clearer.


SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS:
------------------------
You must have the IzPack installer system installed.  See www.izforge.com.


TO CREATE AN INSTALLER:
--------------------------
1. Jar all libraries (xj3d, all libraries in /jars; can probably use Ant for all but xj3d)
2. Have a license file and HelloPanel HTML file ready (samples in /doc)
3. Prepare the module's manifest file (samples in /manifests)
4. Build the module with Ant.
4. Jar the module (sample jar command in /jar_scripts)
5. Prepare the installer's XML file (sample provided in installer.xml)
6. Create the installer (sample commands in build_installer.bat)
7. Test your installer!  (The sample one's manifest has a bad class-path, but if you add
                          all of the sdl, wtcore, xj3d, etc. jars individually to that 
                          attribute, it should work.  Run it from the command line to 
                          see where it fails to find an SDL class.  [java -jar circular.jar])
