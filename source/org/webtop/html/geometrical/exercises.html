    1:</span></b>&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>Converging Lens: Object Outside the Focal Point</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Starting from the default situation, grab the observation screen Position widget (the red cone on its top) and pull the screen towards the lens (but not past it). Now pull the screen back towards the image plane position, and then past it. How does the ray pattern on the screen change as you pass through the image plane?

    2:</span></b>&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>Image Formation by a Two Lens System: Real Intermediate Image</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">(a) Click the reset button to return to the default situation. Use the Position keyboard entry box to set the position of the lens to 20 cm and the Focal Length keyboard entry box to set its focal length to 10 cm. Click the Add button to add a second converging lens. Use its keyboard entry boxes to set its position to 60 cm and focal length to 10 cm. Select the Observation screen and set its position to be 80 cm. Choose the image quality to be Very High. You should see the situation depicted in figure below. <br><br>

(b) Use the mouse cursor to grab the red cone widget on the top of the observation screen and pull the screen to the left until you find the real image formed between the two lenses.

    3:</span></b>&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>Image Formation by a Two Lens System: Virtual Object for the Second Lens</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Click the reset button to return to the default situation. Set the image quality to Very High. Add a converging lens. Set its position to 50 cm. Set its focal length to 40 cm. Select the observation screen and set its position to 70 cm. You should see the scene depicted in the figure below.<br><br>

    4:</span></b>&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>Astronomical Telescope</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Click the reset button to return to the default situation. From the Source pull-down menu choose T at Infinity. Set the position of the converging lens to be 1 cm and its focal length to be 50 cm. From the pull down menu in the center of the console, choose Converging Lens, then click on the Add button. Set the position of this lens to be 56 cm and its focal length to 5 cm. Move the observation screen to the left until it almost touches the first lens, and then slowly to the right until it reaches the end of the optical bench. How did the distribution of rays on the screen change? (Comment: the T is not really at infinity, but it is hundreds of meters from the first lens.)
