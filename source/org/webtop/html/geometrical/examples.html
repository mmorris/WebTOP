</P>
<p>In this example parallel rays from a distant on-axis point source are incident upon a converging lens whose focal length is 30 cm. The observation screen begins just to the left of the lens and is moved towards the right to show the behavior of the rays. As the observation screen moves away from the lens, the rays converge to an on-axis point that is 30 cm to the right of the lens - the image focal point of the lens, F<sub>i</sub>. The image focal plane of the lens is the plane that is perpendicular to the principal axis of the lens and contains F<sub>i</sub>. As the observation screen moves away from the image focal plane of the lens the rays start to diverge. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

</P>
<p>In this example an on-axis point source is 30 cm to the left of a converging lens whose focal length is 30 cm, i.e. the position of the point source coincides with the object focal point , F<sub>o</sub>, of the lens. The observation screen begins just to the left of the lens and is moved towards the right to show the behavior of the rays. The rays that exit the lens all travel parallel to the principal axis of the lens. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

</P>
<p>In this example parallel rays from a distant on-axis point source are incident upon a diverging lens whose focal length is -60 cm. The observation screen begins just to the left of the lens and is moved towards the right to show the behavior of the rays. The rays exiting the lens are diverging as if they came from a point source located 60 cm to the left of the lens, i.e. from the image focal point of the lens, F<sub>i</sub>. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

</P>
<p>In this example an object (five point sources in the shape of a T) is 45 cm to the left of a converging lens whose focal length is 30 cm. The observation screen is initially positioned just to the left of the lens. The screen is then moved towards the right in order to show the behavior of the rays. The rays exiting the lens converge and form a real image in the image plane, which is 90 cm to the right of the lens. The rays then diverge as they leave the image plane. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

</P>
<p>In this example an object (five point sources in the shape of a T) is 20 cm to the left of a converging lens whose focal length is 30 cm. The observation screen is initially positioned just to the right of the lens. The screen is then moved towards the right in order to show the behavior of the rays. The rays exiting the lens diverge and never form a real image. However, the eye of an observer to the right of the lens would trace these rays back, and the observer would see a virtual image at the position where those hypothetical traced-back rays cross. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

<p>In this example an object (five point sources in the shape of a T) is 40 cm to the left of a diverging lens whose focal length is -20 cm. The observation screen is initially positioned just to the right of the lens. The screen is then moved towards the right in order to show the behavior of the rays.

<p><a name="Ex1"><font class="title1">Example 7&nbsp; Two Converging Lenses - Virtual Intermediate Image</FONT></a>
</P>
<p>In this example an object (five point sources in the shape of a T) is 20 cm to the left of a converging lens whose focal length is 40 cm. A second converging lens of focal length 20 cm is 50 cm to the right of the first lens. The observation screen is initially positioned just to the right of the first lens. The screen is then moved towards the right in order to show the behavior of the rays. The rays exiting the first lens diverge, which means that the first lens forms a virtual image to the left of the first lens. This image serves as the object for the second lens. The second lens converges the rays incident upon it to form a real image 25.7 cm to the right of the second lens. As the observation screen moves past this final image plane, the rays begin to diverge. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.

<p><a name="Ex1"><font class="title1">Example 8&nbsp; Two Converging Lenses - Virtual Object for the Second Lens</FONT></a>
</P>
<p>In this example an object (five point sources in the shape of a T) is 60 cm to the left of a converging lens whose focal length is 40 cm. A second converging lens of focal length 20 cm is 80 cm to the right of the first lens. The observation screen is initially positioned just to the right of the first lens. The screen is then moved towards the right in order to show the behavior of the rays. The rays exiting the first lens converge, but before a real image is formed, the second lens intercepts the rays and converges them even more, forming a real final image 13.3 cm to the right of the second lens. In this case, the image that would have been formed by the first lens (if the second lens were absent) serves as a virtual object for the second lens. . As the observation screen moves past this final image plane, the rays begin to diverge. The ray diagram for this situation is pictured below.
