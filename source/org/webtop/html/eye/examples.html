</P>
<p>In this example the eye is normal: its far point (FP) is at infinity and its near point (NP) is 25.0 cm from the eye. The object begins within the range of clear vision of the eye, i.e., in between its near point and far point. Its image is therefore formed on the retina of the eye. First, the object is moved away from the eye. The eye automatically accommodates for the increase in object distance, and the image remains on the retina. The image size decreases as the object distance increases. Next, the object distance is decreased. The eye automatically accommodates for the decrease in object distance until the object is inside the near point. In this case the image "forms" behind the retina. Comment: In a real eye the image cannot actually form behind the retina, because the light does not transmit through the retina. We are depicting the situation as if the retina was transparent and the image could form.

<p>In this example the far point and near point of the eye are, respectively, 60.0 cm and 17.7 cm from the eye. The object begins within the range of clear vision, and its image is formed on the retina. The object is then moved away from the eye. The eye automatically accommodates for the change in object distance until the object is past the far point. In this case the image forms in front of the retina. Next, the object distance is decreased. Once the object is inside the far point, the eye automatically accommodates (and the image remains on the retina) until the object is inside the near point. In this case the image forms behind the retina.

<p>In this example the far point of the eye is infinity and the near point is 45.0 cm from the eye. The object begins inside the near point, and its image is formed behind the retina. The object is then moved away from the eye. Once the object is past the near point, its image is formed on the retina, no matter how large the object distance is. The object is then moved towards the eye. The eye accommodates (and the image remains on the retina) until the object is inside the near point. In this case the image forms behind the retina.

</P>
<p>In this example the far point and near point of the eye are, respectively, 60.0 cm and 17.7 cm from the eye. The object begins within the range of clear vision of the eye. It is then moved away from the eye until it is past the far point and its image forms in front of the retina. A diverging lens is then added that makes the new far point (NFP) of the eye infinity. Its new near point (NNP) is located 24.0 cm from the eye. The object is now within the new range of clear vision and is imaged on the retina. The object is then brought closer to the eye. Eventually the object is inside the new near point, and its image forms behind the retina. Comment: The faint yellow arrow sometimes seen on the same "track" as the object is the virtual image formed by the diverging lens.

<p>In this example the far point of the eye is infinity and the near point is 45.0 cm from it. The object begins inside the near point, and its image is behind the retina. A converging lens is added which makes the new near point distance 25.0 cm. The new far point distance is 53.1 cm. The object is now in the range of clear vision, and its image forms on the retina. The object is then moved out past the new far point, and its image is formed in front of the retina. The image is then moved closer to the eye, until it is inside the new near point. Its image is now formed behind the retina. Comment: The faint yellow arrow sometimes seen on the same "track" as the object is the virtual image formed by the converging lens.
