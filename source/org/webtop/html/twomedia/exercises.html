<p>Starting from the default settings, first click on the second viewpoint icon to get an overhead view. 
<br>(a) Use the mouse cursor to grab the bottom of the long bar on the line wave widget, and rotate it clockwise to decrease the angle of incidence. Does the angle of refraction increase or decrease? 
<br>(b) Now rotate the bar in the counterclockwise direction and increase the angle of incidence to approximately 60 degrees. Did the angle of refraction increase or decrease? Click on the Incident Only button to display only the incident wave in medium 1. Next, click on Reflected Only button to display only the reflected wave in medium 2. Finally, click on the Both button to display the total disturbance again.

    2:</span></b><b>&nbsp; </span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Glass to Air: Varying the Angle of Incidence</span></p>

<p>Use the keyboard entry boxes to change n1 to 1.50, n2 to 1.00, and the angle of incidence to 10 degrees. The critical angle for this situation is 41.82 degrees. If you do not currently have an overhead view, please click on the second viewpoint icon.
<br>(a) Use the keyboard entry box to change the angle of incidence to 20 degrees, and then to 40 degrees. Does the angle of refraction increases or decrease?
<br>(b) Use the keyboard entry box to change the angle of incidence to 41 degrees, then to 41.5 degrees, and then to 41.8 degrees. What value is the angle of refraction approaching? Click on the Animation button, and then the Play button to see these waves in motion.
<br>(c) Click on the first viewpoint icon to get a non-overhead view. Use the keyboard entry box to change the angle of incidence to 42 degrees. The wave in the air, i.e., on the right of the interface, is an evanescent wave. It travels parallel to the interface, and decays in the direction perpendicular to the interface.
<br>(d) The "penetration depth" of the evanescent wave depends on the angle of incidence. Use the keyboard entry box to change the angle of incidence to 45 degrees, then 50 degrees, then 60 degrees. Does the penetration depth of the evanescent wave increase or decrease as the angle of incidence is increased?
