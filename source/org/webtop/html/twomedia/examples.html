</P>
<p>In this example we consider a monochromatic plane wave of s-polarized light to be incident from air (index of refraction = 1.00) onto a planar interface with glass (index of refraction = 1.50). 
<br>(a) The angle of incidence is 30°. Initially the field displayed on the left (the field in the air) is the incident field. After a few seconds, the reflected field is shown, and after a few more seconds the superposition of the incident and reflected fields is shown.
<br>(b) The same as (a), except the angle of incidence is 60°.
<br>(c) The same as (a), except the angle of incidence is 89.99°. Note that since the incident and reflected waves have approximately the same amplitude and are 180° degrees out of phase, the superposition of the two gives a wave of approximately zero amplitude.

<br>(c) The same as (a), except the angle of incidence is 42°. Note that total internal reflection is occurring. The waves in the air are evanescent waves that travel parallel to the interface, and have amplitudes that decay in the direction perpendicular to the interface.
<br>(d) The angle of incidence is increased to 42.5°, and then 45.0. The penetration depth of the evanescent waves decreases as the angle of incidence is increased.

<p>In this example we consider a monochromatic plane wave of s-polarized light to be normally incident from air (index of refraction 1.00) onto a planar interface with a second medium of index of refraction n<sub>2</sub>.
<br>(a) n<sub>2</sub> = 1.50. Initially the field displayed on the left (the field in the air) is the incident field. After a few seconds, the reflected field is shown, and after a few more seconds the superposition of the incident and reflected fields is shown.
<br>(b) n<sub>2</sub> = 3.00. Initially the field displayed on the left (the field in the air) is the incident field. After a few seconds, the reflected field is shown, and after a few more seconds the superposition of the incident and reflected fields is shown. Note that in this case the superposition of the incident and reflected waves is approximately a standing wave.
