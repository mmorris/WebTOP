    1:</span></b>&nbsp; <span style='color:blue'>Confocal Resonator</span></span></p>

<p dir="ltr">Set the wavelength to be 700 nm, the radius of curvature of each mirror to be 1000 mm, the length of the cavity to be 1000 mm, Screen to be 2000 mm, and the transverse mode to be TEM 00. 
<br>(a) Use the Wavelength keyboard entry box to change the wavelength from 700 to 400 and back twice. For which wavelength is the beam wider? Why is it wider?
<br>(b) Use the Rotate widget to get a more "head-on" view of the observation screen. Use the Screen widget to move the screen towards the laser to Screen = 1200 mm. How many times larger is the intensity at the center of the beam at this position, as compared to the original position?
<br>(c) Use the Screen widget to move the back to the position Screen = 2000 mm. Select TEM 10 in the Transverse Mode Menu. This inserts a vertical wire into the cavity that forces the laser to lase 
in its TEM 10 mode. How many vertical nodal lines (I=0) are occurring? How many 
horizontal nodal lines are occurring?
<br>(d) Select TEM 01 in the Transverse Mode Menu. This inserts a horizontal wire into the cavity that forces the laser to lase 
in its TEM 01 mode. How many vertical nodal lines (I=0) are occurring? How many 
horizontal nodal lines are occurring?<br>(e) Select TEM 11 in the Transverse Mode Menu. This inserts crossed wires into the cavity that forces the laser to lase 
in its TEM 11 mode. How many intensity nodes are there on the horizontal axis on 
the observation screen? How many are there on the vertical axis?

    2:</span></b><b>&nbsp; </span></b><span style='font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Near-Concentric Resonator</span></p>

<p>Click on the first viewpoint icon. Set the wavelength to be 550 nm, the radius of curvature of each mirror to be 540 mm, the length of the cavity to be 1000 mm, Screen to be 2000 mm, and the transverse mode to be TEM 00.
<br>(a) Use the Beam brightness slider to make the beam inside the cavity brighter. The location in the center of the cavity where the beam width is the smallest is called the beam waist.
<br>(b) Use the Rotate widget to get a more "head-on" view of the observation screen. Use the Screen widget to move the screen towards the laser to Screen = 1200. How many times larger is the intensity at the center of the beam at this position, as compared to the original position?
<br>(c) Change the two radii of curvatures to 1000 mm. This makes the resonator a confocal resonator. Which resonator produces a more collimated beam, the near-concentric or the confocal?
