<P>Consider a monochromatic plane wave of wavelength <IMG SRC="figs/lambda.jpg" ALIGN=TOP width="17" height="16">
 traveling in the positive z-direction.  If the field is completely polarized, then it is 
either linearly polarized, circularly polarized, or elliptically polarized.  In this module
 the user can do two different type of activities.</P>
</P>
<P>First, the user can create any type of completely polarized light by selecting values 
for (a) the amplitude of the x-component, call it E<SUB>ox</SUB>
, of the initial electric field vector, (b) the amplitude of the 
y-component, call it E<SUB>oy</SUB>, 
of the initial electric field vector, (c) the phase difference between these two 
components, and (d) the wavelength of the light. The user can then see a set of electric 
field vectors at various points on the positive z-axis, and watch the wave travel across 
the computer screen.</P>
<P>Secondly, the user can insert a filter into the path of the propagating electric field, 
which was just created.  Currently two types of filters are available: linear polarizers 
and retarders (wave plates).</P>

<P>The electric field vector of any completely polarized monochromatic plane wave 
traveling in the positive z-direction can be written as </P>
<P><IMG SRC="figs/polarization/Image1.gif" WIDTH=428 HEIGHT=33 ALIGN=CENTER>.</P>
<P>Here E<SUB>ox</SUB> is the amplitude of the 
x-component, 
E<SUB>oy</SUB> is the amplitude 
of the y-component, <FONT FACE="Symbol">&#100;</FONT>
is the phase difference between the two components, <IMG SRC="figs/polarization/Image4.gif" WIDTH=80 
HEIGHT=28 ALIGN=CENTER> is the wave number, and <IMG SRC="figs/polarization/Image5.gif" WIDTH=117 HEIGHT=26 
ALIGN=CENTER> is its angular frequency.</P>
<LI>Filters</LI></OL>
<P>In order to calculate the effect that a filter has on the electric field which is 
incident upon it, we used the Jones vector/Jones matrix approach.  In this approach, the 
electric field vector incident upon the filter is represented by a two component column 
vector (its Jones vector).  The filter is represented by a 2 x 2 matrix (its Jones matrix).
 The two component column vector which represents the electric field emerging from the 
other side of the filter (its Jones vector) is obtained by  multiplying the Jones matrix 
for the filter by the Jones vector of the incident field.</P>
<P>For a polarizer filter the important parameter is the angle that the transmission axis of the polarizer makes with the positive x-axis (or positive y-axis).  For a wave plate the important parameters are the number of waves of optical path length difference it provides (between the x- and y-components of the field) and the direction that the fast axis of the wave plate makes with respect to the positive x-axis (or positive y-axis).</P>
