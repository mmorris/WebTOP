<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>he Optics Project (TOP) is a
multidisciplinary effort to develop an interactive computer graphics
system for the simulation and visualization of optical phenomena. TOP
is intended to serve two major functions. First, TOP is a pedagogical
framework from which optics and field-related physics can be taught.
This aspect of TOP is currently being supported by the 
<A HREF="http://www.nsf.gov/">NSF</A> under the
project title "An Interactive Computer Graphics System for the Teaching
of Undergraduate Optics." Second, TOP is an environment in which more
sophisticated new algorithms for simulation and visualization can be
developed.

<P><FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>OP has a modular structure, and each module is designed to be: (a) interactive, (b) three-dimensional, and (c) animated (for those phenomena for which animation is appropriate). Faculty and students from three different departments 
(
<A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu/Dept/Physics">
Physics and Astronomy</A>, 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.msstate.edu">
Computer Science</A>, and 
<A HREF="http://www.ece.msstate.edu">
Electrical and Computer Engineering</A>
) are working or have worked on TOP. This work is being carried out at the 
<A HREF="http://www.erc.msstate.edu">NSF Engineering Research Center for Computational Field Simulation</A> at MSU.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR><BR>
Currently TOP runs on <A HREF="http://www.sgi.com">SGI </A>workstations.  Recently we have created a
web version (which we call WebTOP) of one TOP module using VRML 2.0
and Java.  WebTOP is fully 3D and interactive and runs on the Web.<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>OP was used to help teach a junior/senior level optics course in the
Department of Physics and Astronomy at 
<A HREF="http://www.msstate.edu">Mississippi State University </A>during 
the spring semesters of 1997 and 1998.  It was used to help teach a
junior/senior level optics course in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy at the <A HREF="http://www.physics.unc.edu">
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill </A>during the
spring semester of 1998.  It will be used to help teach an Electromagnetic
Fields course in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at
Mississippi State University this coming fall.
