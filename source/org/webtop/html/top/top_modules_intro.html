<FONT SIZE="+1"><B>T</B></FONT>OP is comprised of seven modules: Wave Simulation, Reflection and
Refraction, Geometrical Optics, Polarization, Interference, Fraunhofer
Diffraction, and Fresnel Diffraction.  A web page for each  module may be
accessed through the links provided in the frame on the left of this
screen.   In the web page for each module we have provided you with links
to<BR><BR>
<DD>1. A brief theory which relates to that module,<BR>
<DD>2. Still pictures taken from  the module at work,<BR>
<DD>3. Movies created from images which were captured during a TOP session
with that module.<BR><BR>

In addition, on the Single Slit section of the Fresnel Diffraction module
page, there is a link to an interactive 3D web based version of this
submodule which was created using VRML 2.0 and Java.
<BR><BR>
Please note that you may need one or more of the following plugins to your
web browser to view the movies/VRML models of the modules. Links to locations
from where you can download these plugins are provided in the appropriate
places. We recommend you to follow the links provided here to download
those plugins before hand, if your browser doesn't have them already.<BR><BR>
<DD>1. You will need 
<A HREF="http://www.apple.com/quicktime">
QuickTime</A> movieplayer plugin to view the movies.<BR>
<DD>2. You will need the 
<A HREF="http://cosmosoftware.com/download/index_player.html">
CosmoPlayer</A> plugin to view the VRML models.<BR>
<DD>3. In addition, your web browser should support Java scripting.
