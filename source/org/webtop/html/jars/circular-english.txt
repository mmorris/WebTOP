diameter_dragger_hlp,Use these red cones to adjust the diameter of the aperture.
screen_dragger_hlp,Use these red cones to adjust the distance of the observation screen from the slit.
wavelength_wheel_hlp,Spin the wheel to change the wavelength of the light (clockwise for longer wavelength).
diameter_dragger_err,The aperture must have a non-negative diameter of no more than a millimeter.
screen_dragger_err,The screen distance must be between 20 and 200 mm.
wavelength_wheel_err,The wavelength must be visible (400-700 nm).
