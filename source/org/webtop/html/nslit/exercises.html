  <hr><a name="NSlit_1"></a><font color="#800000"><strong>Exercise 
    1:&nbsp; </strong></font><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue;font-weight:normal'>Single 
    Slit – Effect of Changing the Slit Width or the Wavelength</span></h2>

<p>Set the number of slits to
be 1, the wavelength to be 500 nm, the slit width to be 0.10 mm, and <i>z</i>
to be 1000 mm. “Distance” is irrelevant since there is only one slit.</span></p>

<p>(a) Use one of the red cone
widgets on the slit to increase the width of the slit.&nbsp; Does the intensity pattern on the
observation screen get wider or narrower? Justify this using the equation that
describes the angular position of the first off-axis minimum of the pattern.</span></p>

<p>(b) Use the wheel widget to
increase the wavelength of the light. Does the intensity pattern on the
observation screen get wider or narrower? Justify this using the equation that
describes the angular position of the first off-axis minimum of the pattern.</span></p>


  <hr><a name="NSlit_2"></a><font color="#800000"><strong>Exercise 2:&nbsp; </strong></font><span style='font-size:
10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:blue'>Double Slit – Effect of Changing the Distance 
    Between the Slits, or the Slit Width, or the Wavelength</span></p>

<p>Set the number of slits to
be 2, the wavelength to be 500 nm, the slit width to be 0.005 mm, the distance
between slits to be 0.20 mm, and <i>z</i> to be 1000 mm. </span></p>

<p>(a) Use the blue cone
widget on one of the slits to decrease the distance between the slits.&nbsp; Do the off-axis maxima move towards the axis
or away from it? Justify this using the equation that describes the angular
position of the first order maximum of the pattern.</span></p>

<p>(b) Use the wheel widget to
increase the wavelength of the light. Do the off-axis maxima move towards the
axis or away from it?&nbsp; Justify this
using the equation that describes the angular position of the first order
maximum of the pattern.</span></p>

<p>(c) Use the appropriate
keyboard entry boxes to set the distance between slits to 0.40 and the
wavelength to 500 nm. Use one of the red cone widgets on a slit to increase the
width of the slits to approximately 0.05 mm. Do the positions of the maxima
change? Do the peak intensities of the maxima change? Increase the slit width
again until it is 0.10 mm. Comment upon any similarities between this intensity
pattern and the intensity pattern you saw in Exercise 1 (a) above. (Hint: Use
the Slits keyboard entry box to change the number of slits to 1, and watch what
happens.)</span></p>

    than 2 Slits - Effect of Changing the Number of Slits</span></p>

<p>Set the number of slits to
be 2, the wavelength to be 500 nm, the slit width to be 0.005 mm, the distance
between slits to be 0.10 mm, and <i>z</i> to be 1000 mm.&nbsp; Let us refer to the maxima we observe now as
“major maxima.”</span></p>

<p>(a) Use the “Slits”
keyboard entry box to change the number of slits to 3.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Did the positions of the major maxima change?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) How many “secondary” maxima occur between every two
consecutive major maxima?&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Did the major maxima become wider or narrower?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Did the peak intensities of the major maxima change? (You
will need to consult the scale on the white intensity graph above the
observation screen to determine this.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>

<p>(b) Use the “Slits” keyboard entry box to change the number of slits to 5.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (i) Did the positions of the major maxima change?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (ii) How many “secondary” maxima occur between every two
consecutive major maxima?&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iii) Did the major maxima become wider or narrower?</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (iv) Did the peak intensities of the major maxima change? </span></p>

<p>(c) Based on what you have
seen in (a) and (b) above, if the number of slits is N, how many “secondary”
maxima will occur between every two consecutive major maxima? How does the peak
intensity of a major maximum vary with N?</span></p>

<p>(d) Use the “Slits”
keyboard entry box to change the number of slits to 10. Is what you see
consistent with your answers to part (c)?</span></p>
