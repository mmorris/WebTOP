  This DTD defines the WebTOP Scripting Language that is used by
  WebTOP modules for recording user interactions.  Scripting-capable
  WebTOP modules record user actions and write a file in the WSL
  format.  These modules can later load the WSL file back and play
  back the user actions.

  The old (read: current) actionPerformed has a dual nature: simple
  functions like "Reset" that have no parameters or values, and setting
  parameters (usually other than with the mouse).  I believe it makes sense
  to allow actionPerformed to keep its "target" attribute, because one
  could in theory reset only a certain source, or in some other way 'do'
  something to it.

  It is questionable that mouseDragged should have a value; in some modules,
  it is always accompanied by an actionPerformed (or parameterSet) anyway.
  However, as it stands it is useful to distinguish between a widget
  interaction and a console interaction, and it is convenient to carry that
  distinction even in the individual events (as opposed to relying on
  mousepressed and mousereleased events), so it can probably stay.  Ideally, a
  mouse interaction (a down, maybe drags, and an up) would be a mouse tag:

<!ELEMENT mouse (drag*)>
<!ATTLIST mouse
	target	CDATA	#IMPLIED
	param	CDATA	#IMPLIED
	downStamp	CDATA	"0"
	upStamp	CDATA	"0">

<!ELEMENT drag EMPTY>
<!ATTLIST drag
	value	CDATA	#IMPLIED
	timeStamp	CDATA	"0">

  This, however, incurs the cost of destroying the linear concept of a script.
  An alternative would be to specify in the script sub-element list that such
  events came in (mousePressed, mouseDragged*, mouseReleased) packets.

  Mouse entered and exited events should not be so atomic as they can be
  freely intermixed with keyboard (console) interactions.
