This document is the API specification for the WebTOP Scripting Language API (WSLAPI) version 3.1.

The WSL library provides recording and playback services for WebTOP modules, as well as a user interface ({@link webtop.wsl.client.WSLPanel}) for controlling a {@link webtop.wsl.client.WSLPlayer}.  A WebTOP module provides this interface as part of its applet.  <!--if/when more of WebTOP is javadoc-ed, this should go into the webtop.wsl.client package file-->
