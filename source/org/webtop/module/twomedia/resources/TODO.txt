Figure out how to print out the viewpoint from the xj3d console window.  Look at www.web3d.org.  

In Engine.java, need to get rid of all of the direct accesses to the sai.  
Same for LinerSource.java, Pool.java, and WaveSource.java

WaveSource.java:
There is no direct access to the x3d file.  No changes necessary. 

Engine.java:
1. Hide Widgets and show widgets works properly, but the show markers choice isn't working. Will save for last
2.


Pool.java:

LinearSource.java:

 

Need to convert one class at a time. Will have to remove all of the buttons and make them either toggle or 
state buttons.  The JLabels should be fine, just move them over.  Be sure and get all of the event handling stuff
from the files.  Create JLabel that holds both critical angle and the number value. 



ADD THE REST OF THE CONTROL PANEL BEFORE THE RESET BUTTON.  THE RESET BUTTON IS WORKING PROPERLY.  ADD THE OTHER
PARTS OF THE CONTROL PANEL NOW. (BE SURE TO LEAVE IN THE SOURCE PANEL DECLARATION OR THE POOL WILL NOT LOAD).

MOVE THE OTHER BUTTONS FROM THE CONTROL PANEL OVER NEXT. MOVE THE LISTENERS ALONG WITH THEM.  MAKE SURE THAT THE
ENGINE CALLS ARE TO THE PROPER ENGINE.
