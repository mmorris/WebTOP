Rules:

First element only (for Foley Hokeyness):

When not dragging:	If solid angle decreases, prune (how?).
When dragging:	If solid angle decreases, do nothing.
When releasing a widget:	If solid angle has decreased, prune (how?).

Always:
If solid angle increases, incremental hooking.
If source changes, recalculate.
If user asks, recalculate.

Solid angle can change upon
dragging: radius/size/position change to first element (including reordering of elements)
not dragging: any of the above, plus addition or removal of elements

These rules are nice, but faulty for off axis points (solid angle can decrease and yet add new directions in which rays must be cast).
