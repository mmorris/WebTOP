  <strong>(a)</strong> Use the red cone widget to make the diameter of the aperture 1 mm.
  The Fresnel number is now 10.0. Is the intensity on-axis (i.e., at the center of the pattern) a maximum or a minimum? Starting
  at one edge of the intensity pattern and proceeding across it through the origin to the
  other edge, how many &quot;major&quot; maxima do you encounter?<br>
  <strong>(b)</strong> Use the red cone widget to decrease the diameter of the aperture
  until the Fresnel number is 8.0. Is the intensity on-axis a maximum or a minimum? Starting
  at one edge of the intensity pattern and proceeding across it through the origin to the
  other edge, how many &quot;major&quot; maxima do you encounter?<br>
